<img src="images/module2-step4-github-folder-created.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step4-GithubFolderCreated">

### Step 5: Review Generated Artifacts
A .github folder is created to store modernization artifacts and logs

<img src="images/module2-step3-tool-execution.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step3-ToolExecution">
   
### Step 6: Review AppCAT Configuration Options
Scroll down in the GitHub Copilot chat to see the AppCAT tool configuration. [AppCAT for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/appcat/java?view=migrate-classic) is Azure Migrate's application and code assessment tool that App Mod for Java uses to perform static code analysis against your Java workload. It uses advanced analysis techniques to understand your application's structure and dependencies, identifying replatforming and migration opportunities for Azure.

The tool offers various targets including `azure-aks` for AKS deployment, `openjdk17` for Java 17 upgrade, and `cloud-readiness` for Azure optimization. Analysis modes include `source-only` for code analysis or `full` for code and dependency analysis.

**What AppCAT Does:**
- **Discovers technology usage** in your legacy applications
- **Assesses code for specific Azure targets** (AKS, App Service, Container Apps)
- **Identifies modifications needed** to replatform to Azure
- **Provides Azure-specific replatforming rules** and best practices

<img src="images/module2-step5-appcat-configuration.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step5-AppCATConfiguration">

#### Configure Assessment Parameters
In the GitHub Copilot chat, you'll see the "Run `appmod-run-assessment`" tool with configuration options. This is where you can customize the assessment targets and analysis mode. 

   **Default Configuration:**
   ```json
   {
     "workspacePath": "<path to project>/src",
     "appCatConfig": {
       "target": ["azure-aks", "azure-appservice", "azure-container-apps", "cloud-readiness"],
       "mode": "source-only"
     }
   }
   ```

   **For AKS-focused migration, update to:**
   ```json
   {
     "workspacePath": "<path to project>/src",
     "appCatConfig": {
       "target": ["azure-aks", "cloud-readiness"],
       "mode": "source-only"
     }
   }
   ```

   **What this means:**
   - **`azure-aks`**: Targets AKS-specific modernization rules and best practices
   - **`cloud-readiness`**: Focuses on general Azure cloud optimization
   - **`mode: "source-only"**: Analyzes source code without dependency scanning (faster)

   **Action:** Either modify the JSON in the Input section or copy-paste the AKS-focused configuration above.
    
   <img src="images/module2-step6-configure-assessment-parameters.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step6-ConfigureAssessmentParameters">

### Step 7: Execute Assessment
Click the "Run" button to start the AppCAT assessment. The tool will analyze your Spring Boot PetClinic application using the configured parameters.

> **Note:** The assessment process may take a few minutes to complete as it thoroughly analyzes your codebase against 935+ rules. This is normal - grab a coffee while it runs! ‚òï

### Step 8: Review Assessment Results
After the assessment completes, you'll see a success message in the GitHub Copilot chat summarizing what was accomplished:

<img src="images/module2-step7-assessment-report-details.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step7-AssessmentReportDetails">

**What the assessment accomplished:**
- **Prerequisites Verified**: AppCAT CLI environment setup and validation
- **Configuration Applied**: Assessment performed with `azure-aks` and `cloud-readiness` targets
- **Analysis Executed**: Processed 838 rules out of 935 total rules
- **Report Generated**: Assessment report opened in webview interface

### Step 9: Review Detailed Assessment Report
The assessment report opens in VS Code showing detailed findings:

<img src="images/module2-step7-assessment-report-chat-summary.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step7-AssessmentReportChatSummary">

**Key sections to review:**
- **Issue Summary**: 8 cloud readiness issues, 1 Java upgrade issue
- **Solution Coverage**: 54% of issues can be resolved via Microsoft solutions
- **Cloud Readiness Issues**: Database migration recommendations for Azure PostgreSQL
- **Criticality Levels**: Mandatory (purple), Potential (blue), Optional (gray)

**Next steps from the report:**
- Review identified issues and their severity levels
- Use Microsoft solutions for 54% of issues
- Leverage GitHub Copilot for remaining issues
- Plan your migration based on findings

### Step 10: Review Specific Findings
Click on individual issues in the report to see detailed recommendations. For this lab, we'll focus on the key findings:

   **Primary Focus - Database Migration (PostgreSQL):**
   - **Issue**: PostgreSQL database found in configuration files
   - **Files affected**: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `application.properties`, `application-postgres.properties`
   - **Recommendation**: Migrate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
   - **Action**: Use Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) for online migration with minimal downtime

   **Security Finding - Local Credentials:**
   - **Issue**: Passwords found in plaintext configuration files
   - **Files affected**: `application-mysql.properties`, `application-postgres.properties`, `application.properties`
   - **Recommendation**: Migrate from plaintext credentials to Azure Key Vault
   - **Action**: Implement passwordless connections using Entra ID authentication

   **Caching Finding - Embedded Cache Management:**
   - **Issue**: Spring Boot Cache library embedded in application
   - **File affected**: `pom.xml` (Line 50)
   - **Recommendation**: Migrate to Azure Cache for Redis
   - **Action**: Replace embedded cache with backing service

   **Note**: While the report identifies multiple issues, this lab will focus on the PostgreSQL migration to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with Entra AD authentication, and the embedded cache migration to Azure Cache for Redis. Additional security findings will be addressed in future lab modules.

### Step 11: Take Action on Findings
The assessment report offers two types of migration actions based on AppCAT findings:

- **Guided migration (blue "Migrate" button)**: For findings that GitHub Copilot Application Modernization for Java can currently automate, click the blue "Migrate" button to trigger a curated remediation flow with step-by-step guidance.
- **Unguided migration ("Ask Copilot" button)**: For findings that are not yet automated by the GitHub Copilot Application Modernization for Java tooling, use the "Ask Copilot" button to work directly with GitHub Copilot in agent mode using ready-to-use prompts that reference the specific finding, affected files, and target Azure service.

<img src="images/module2-step11-guided-migration-vs-copilot-prompts.png" width="100%" alt="Module2-Step11-GuidedMigrationVsCopilotPrompts">

**For this lab, we will focus on modernizing the PetClinic workload by:**
- **Database Migration**: Migrating the self-hosted PostgreSQL database that uses basic authentication to Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server using Entra ID authentication and AKS Workload Identity
- **Caching Migration**: Migrating from in-memory caching in Spring to Azure Cache for Redis, also using Entra ID authentication and AKS Workload Identity

### Step 12: Select PostgreSQL Migration Task
Begin the modernization by selecting the desired migration task. For our Spring Boot application, we will migrate to Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server using the Spring option. The other options shown are for generic JDBC usage.

<img src="images/module2-step12-select-postgres-migration-task.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step12-SelectPostgresMigrationTask">

**Note:** Choose the "Spring" option for Spring Boot applications, as it provides Spring-specific optimizations and configurations. The generic JDBC options are for non-Spring applications.

### Step 13: Execute Postgres Migration Task
Click the "Migrate" button described in the previous section to kick off the modernization changes needed in the PetClinic app. This will update the Java code to work with PostgreSQL Flexible Server using Entra ID authentication.

<img src="images/module2-step12-run-migration-task.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step12-RunMigrationTask">

The tool will execute the `appmod-run-task` command for `managed-identity-spring/mi-postgresql-spring`, which will examine the workspace structure and initiate the migration task to modernize your Spring Boot application for Azure PostgreSQL with managed identity authentication. If prompted to run shell commands, please review and allow each command as the Agent may require additional context before execution.

When the migration task for PostgreSQL with Entra ID authentication begins to run, you will see a chat similar to this in the agent interface:

<img src="images/module2-step13-migration-task-initialized.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step13-MigrationTaskInitialized">

### Step 14: Review Migration Plan and Begin Code Migration
After the migration task initializes, a comprehensive migration plan summary will be provided, outlining the key changes the tool will make to your application. This plan focuses on integrating Azure Managed Identity with PostgreSQL.

**Migration Plan Summary:**
The plan will detail the following key changes:
- **Add Spring Cloud Azure Dependencies**: Adding Spring Cloud Azure BOM version 5.22.0 (compatible with Spring Boot 3.x) and the `spring-cloud-azure-starter-jdbc-postgresql` dependency to both `pom.xml` and `build.gradle`
- **Configure Managed Identity Authentication**: Updating `application.properties` and `application-postgres.properties` to replace username/password authentication with managed identity, add Azure managed identity configuration properties, and enable passwordless authentication

**Files to be Modified:**
- `pom.xml` - Add Spring Cloud Azure dependencies
- `build.gradle` - Add Spring Cloud Azure dependencies  
- `application.properties` - Configure managed identity
- `application-postgres.properties` - Configure managed identity

**Tracking Files Created:**
The tool will create `plan.md` and `progress.md` files in the `.github/appmod-java/code-migration/managed-identity-spring/mi-postgresql-spring-[timestamp]` directory to track what changes are made and why, providing full visibility into the migration process.

**Configuration Settings:**
- VS Code uncommitted changes policy: `Always Stash` (will auto-stash any uncommitted changes)
- New branch will be created for the migration work
- Migration session ID will be provided for tracking

**To Begin the Migration:**
When you're ready to proceed with the PostgreSQL code migration work, type **"Yes"** in the GitHub Agent Chat to begin the automated code changes.

### Step 15: Review Migration Process and Progress Tracking
Once you confirm with "Yes", the migration tool will begin implementing the changes in a structured, two-phase approach. The tool creates a dedicated Git branch for all migration changes to facilitate easy rollback if needed.

**Version Control Setup:**
The tool automatically handles version control by:
- Stashing any uncommitted changes (like `application.properties` modifications)
- Creating a new branch: `appmod/java-managed-identity-spring/mi-postgresql-spring-[timestamp]`
- Ensuring a clean working directory before making changes

**Two-Phase Migration Process:**
This particular migration task has chosen to break up the work into two distinct phases to ensure a systematic and reliable modernization approach. By separating dependency updates from configuration changes, the tool can validate each phase independently and provide better error handling and rollback capabilities.

**Phase 1: Update Dependencies**
- Updates `pom.xml` with Spring Cloud Azure BOM and PostgreSQL starter dependency
- Updates `build.gradle` with corresponding Gradle dependencies
- Adds Spring Cloud Azure version properties

**Phase 2: Configure Application Properties**
- Updates `application.properties` to configure PostgreSQL with managed identity (9 lines added, 2 removed)
- Updates `application-postgres.properties` with Entra ID authentication settings (5 lines added, 4 removed)
- Replaces username/password authentication with managed identity configuration

**Progress Tracking:**
The `progress.md` file is continuously updated throughout the migration process, providing a detailed log of:
- What changes are being made and why
- Which files are being modified
- The rationale behind each modification
- Real-time status of the migration work

This approach ensures full transparency and traceability of all automated changes made to modernize your Spring Boot application for Azure PostgreSQL with Entra ID authentication.

**Validation & Fix Iteration Loop:**
After the migration changes are implemented, the tool automatically enters a validation and fix iteration loop to ensure the application builds successfully. This process includes:

- **CVE Validation**: The tool identifies newly added dependencies and checks for known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
- **Build Validation**: Attempts to build the project and captures any compilation or dependency errors
- **Automated Fixes**: Uses error output to automatically attempt fixes for common issues
- **Iterative Process**: Continues through multiple validation cycles (up to 10 iterations) until the build succeeds

<img src="images/image.png" width="40%" alt="Module2-Step15-ValidationFixLoop">

**User Control:**
At any point during this validation process, you can interrupt the automated fixes and manually resolve issues if you prefer to handle specific problems yourself. The tool provides clear feedback on what it's attempting to fix and allows you to take control when needed.

### Step 16: Review Validation & Fix Loop Results
The validation process progresses through multiple stages, each designed to ensure the migration changes are secure, functional, and consistent. Here's what happens during the validation loop:

**Stage 1: CVE Validation** ‚úÖ
- **Result**: No CVEs detected in the new Spring Cloud Azure dependencies
- **Action**: No changes made - security scan passed

**Stage 2: Build Validation** ‚úÖ
- **Result**: Build successful after migration changes
- **Action**: No changes made - project compiles successfully

**Stage 3: Consistency Validation** ‚úÖ
- **Result**: No consistency issues detected
- **Details**: All changes properly implement Azure Managed Identity for PostgreSQL as specified in the knowledge base
- **Files Validated**: 
  - `pom.xml` - Correctly updated with Azure dependencies
  - `application-postgres.properties` - Properly configured for passwordless authentication
  - `application.properties` - Successfully migrated from H2 to PostgreSQL with managed identity

**Stage 4: Test Validation** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue Detected**: Tests failed with compile errors
- **Error Details**: Maven Surefire plugin failure during test execution
- **Automatic Response**: The tool automatically detects these errors from the build output and initiates debugging

**Automatic Error Detection & Debugging:**
The App Modernization tool doesn't stop when errors occur. Instead, it:
- Automatically parses error messages from build outputs
- Identifies the root cause of compilation or test failures
- Attempts to fix common issues automatically
- Continues through additional validation iterations until all issues are resolved

This intelligent error detection and debugging capability ensures that your application is fully functional after the migration, with all tests passing and no security vulnerabilities introduced.
